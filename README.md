### Maps

The two maps presented are both created from geotweet data that is captured from the same location along the West Coast of the United States and into British Columbia. I was interested in looking at the West Coast specifically since it's more local than the greater US but also a large enough area to collect sufficient data from. Since I wanted to focus on this location I chose to simply do a different time of data collection to ensure a difference in data between the 2 maps. The difference between map 1 (black and yellow) & 2 (white and pink) is that map 1 was created using data captured on 4/14/22 while map 2 was created using data captured on 4/21/22.

### Word Clouds

The two word clouds are created by the same geotweet data as the maps. Map 1 data is word cloud 1, and map 2 data is word cloud 2. The word clouds are also slightly different in there design shape and the way the words are laid out but this is irrelevant to the data and is more for testing purposes than anything else. I find it interesting that many of the words are very different but also it makes sense that some basic words such as "See", "Up", and "Day" could come up frequently in people's writing. We see some crossover between words like "One", "Out", and "Here", so some words seem to be used quite frequently across both datasets despite the large variety of words overall.

_I hope you enjoy these maps and word clouds and find them interesting!_

# Narrative

### Maps

The two maps presented are both created from geotweet data that is captured from the same location along the West Coast of the United States and into British Columbia. The difference between map 1 & 2 is that map 1 was created using data captured on 4/14/22 while map 2 was created using data captured on 4/21/22.

### Word Clouds

The two word clouds are created by the same geotweet data as the maps. Map 1 data is word cloud 1, and map 2 data is word cloud 2. The word clouds are also slightly different in there design shape and the way the words are laid out but this is irrelevant to the data and is more for testing purposes than anything else.


_I hope you enjoy these maps and word clouds and find them interesting!_
